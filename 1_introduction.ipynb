    "\n",
    "**Introduction:** For training bulgarian language tokenizers a high-quality set of validated *words* is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** This project aims at building *the largest vocabulary* of valid Bulgarian words available online.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** Data will be fetched from *Chitanka, GitHub, Kaggle, HuggingFace*, other public and private sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:** The initial `Chitanka` set of words has been increased by `+10.6%`.\n",

    "If someone decides to develop a state-of-the-art tokenizer for Bulgarian language they would need to have an exhaustive list of validated words in Bulgarian language. [Chitanka Rechnik](https://rechnik.chitanka.info/) provide a good starting point with `1M` unique words, but we will try to augment their data further."

    "* **License**: Apache 2.0\n",
    "* **Description**: POS-tagged dataset, specifically designed for token classification.\n",

    "### 4. [BG WordLists](https://github.com/miglen/bulgarian-wordlists)\n",
    "* **Size**: 234 115 words (unique) \n",
    "* **License**: GPL-3.0\n",
    "* **Quality**: Medium-quality (invalid words, dashed words, duplicates). Automatically scrapped and parsed words.\n",
